# Image Classification using Tensorflow on the Intel Image dataset

This is my implementation of classifying the images provided in the intel image dataset and providing a statistical result.

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.
